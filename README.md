My motivation in this repo is to learn accessibility best practices for websites, and become more familiar with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

This project was built to put these learnings into practice. I took an existing repo from another developer (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram) that was lacking in accessibility, with the intent to refactor the original code to be better suited to accessibility standards.

With the refactoring of this code, I learned the importance of Semantic HTML tags, structure, and the advantages this creates for things like screen readers and search engine indexing.
